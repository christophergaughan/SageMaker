## Educational Notebooks

- [**Positional Encoding Explained**](Positional_Encodings.ipynb)  
  A clean walkthrough of how transformer models (like BERT) encode word positions using sinusoidal patterns ‚Äî includes visualizations and code examples. Great for anyone trying to understand the inner workings of attention mechanisms.

# SageMaker ML Pipeline: NLP Classification & MLOps Platform Engineering

This repo demonstrates the full pipeline for deploying NLP models using AWS SageMaker ‚Äî from data ingestion and preprocessing to model training, deployment, and inference. It‚Äôs built with real-world, cloud-native practices in mind, and designed for integration into an internal ML platform like the one described in Genmab's AI & Analytics Engineering team.

## Project Goals

- Classify news headlines into topics using a fine-tuned DistilBERT model
- Train and deploy the model using Amazon SageMaker
- Enable real-time inference via a containerized API (ready for SageMaker hosting)
- Showcase MLOps: containerization, CI/CD automation, infrastructure-as-code
- Document core transformer theory (positional encodings) for team enablement

## Core Features

### Multiclass Text Classification with DistilBERT
- Four target categories: **Business**, **Entertainment**, **Science**, **Health**
- Tokenization and padding via HuggingFace
- Dropout + fully connected classification head

### Containerized Inference
- `inference.py` defines a SageMaker-compatible model serving interface
- Supports JSON-based inputs
- Returns probabilities + predicted label

### üê≥ Docker-Ready

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["python", "inference.py"]
```
### Infrastructure-as-Code
Provisioned via Terraform:
```
resource "aws_sagemaker_notebook_instance" "sagemaker_notebook" {
  name          = "nlp-model-notebook"
  instance_type = "ml.t2.medium"
  role_arn      = aws_iam_role.sagemaker_execution_role.arn
}
```
Also provisions IAM roles with `AmazonSageMakerFullAccess`

### CI/CD Automation
GitHub Actions included in `.github/workflows/train.yml`:

* Lint checks with flake8

* Install dependencies

* (Optional) run training or test workflow
